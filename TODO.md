[x] Add photo rotation
[x] Marigins not working properly (bigger marigin should always be shown on the shorter edge of the photo)
[x] App crashes when print button pushed (should be transfered to sharing options or printing options instead)
[x] Should be possible to choose what to do with too few photos on page: leave part of the paper blank or change the layout
[x] Leave blank space doesnt work on 3 photos per page
[x] Rotating photos doesn't work properly. Photo after loading seems to be stored as cropped. Rotating it doesn't recoverpart of the information. 
[x] Print and sharing buttons doesn't work: Should be only sharing button in place of the printing button. It should allow sharing a created pdf in the typical manner for all the files (sharing has the printing option)

## For further development after the initial bugs are fixed (do not implement now):
[] Swiping right and left changes the page
[] Edition history and recovery of the last edited project
[] Saving project pdf
[] Hold on the photo and dragging it on another causes switching places of the two photos
